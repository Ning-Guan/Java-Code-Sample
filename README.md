# Java-Code-Sample

This project lets new users register and send their registration information
back to the database and store it there. After new users finish their 
registration, the page will redirect to the login page. If people fail to login,
it would go back again to the login page for another try. Once successfully loged in,
they will be able to see all users' information.
